\section*{Task 1}

\subsection*{Question 1}
\textbf{One drawback of stack machines is the need of more memory references.
For a simple \texttt{ADD} operation of two integers, how many times the data cache is referenced?
Write down the steps for the operation.}

\texttt{
\begin{tabbing}
  PUSH 1\\
  PUSH 2\\
  ADD:\=\\
  \> OP1 = POP\\
  \>OP2 = POP\\
  \> PUSH OP1 + OP2\\
\end{tabbing}
}

This results in 5 stack operations (2 pushes, 2 pops, 1 push) and 4 memory references (for reading an writing the operands).
